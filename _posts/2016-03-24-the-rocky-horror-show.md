The Wit is fluffed and ready for Rocky Horror, round two---we're mounting a good old-fashioned revival and we've brought back the whole gang! This Halloween, grab somebody sexy and celebrate another year of weird and wonderful people coming together with a bang.

Featuring reprisals by the 2012 Denver Cast including Erica Trisler (Frank N. Furter), Micheal Lang (Brad Majors), Kerri Elmswiller (Janet Weiss), Rocky Horror '13 will release your tension and re-tease your funny bone!
