Edges is not a musical---Edges is the portrait of a landscape. It is the brush strokes of an instant in the lives of an instantaneous generation. It is painted with music, lyrics, and scene.

Since technology has begun to dominate the interaction of our lives, the connection between one person and another has become the birthplace of a new sort of culture, one where relating to someone on the most intimate level is just as easy as reaching for a device, or just as difficult.

Featuring a cast of nine, Edges takes audiences through a single day--- a single moment--- in the lives of people everybody knows: the ones who can't stop falling in love, the ones who can't start, the ones looking for a way out of each other, or in, and the ones who just want to be who they are but don't know who that is. Each song will ask questions and some will even answer them, but every person in a seat will see the message differently, and connect on a singular level.

"Edges are the flourishing places, between all of us. Have you found yours?"
