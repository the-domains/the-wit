description: "From 2014 Pulitzer Prize-winner Annie Baker comes The Aliens, a 2010 OBIE award-winning slacker comedy about sex, death, failure, and how pretentious it is to sew your own pants. KJ and Jasper, a couple of dropouts, have wasted their 20's behind an indistinct coffee shop in small-town Vermont; Jasper smoking and KJ occasionally bursting into song from their short-lived band. When awkward busboy-in-training Evan asks them to leave, they cheerfully decline, but an unlikely friendship is born."

From 2014 Pulitzer Prize-winner Annie Baker comes The Aliens, a 2010 OBIE award-winning slacker comedy about sex, death, failure, and how pretentious it is to sew your own pants. KJ and Jasper, a couple of dropouts, have wasted their 20's behind an indistinct coffee shop in small-town Vermont; Jasper smoking and KJ occasionally bursting into song from their short-lived band. When awkward busboy-in-training Evan asks them to leave, they cheerfully decline, but an unlikely friendship is born.
