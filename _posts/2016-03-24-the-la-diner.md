Set in a little diner in Hollywood in 1962 near the 20th Century Fox studio where Marilyn Monroe is making her last, and ultimately unfinished film, Something's Got to Give.

Characters from the movie set--Evie, Marilyn's stand in, Walter--the movie's script writer, Ariel--from the studio's commissary, mix, mingle, trade barbs, hopes and fears with Denny, the diner's owner, Em--his elderly hostess, Erica--a waitress, and a self absorbed reporter named Jimmy.
