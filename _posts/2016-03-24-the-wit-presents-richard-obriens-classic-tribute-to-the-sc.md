The Wit in association with Fearless Theatre & Performing Arts Project presents Richard O'Brien's classic tribute to the science fiction and B Horror flicks of the late 1940s through the 1970s.

The musical tells the story of a newly engaged couple getting caught in a storm and coming to the home of a mad transvestite scientist unveiling his new creation, a muscle man named Rocky Horror.

Costumes and virginity optional.
