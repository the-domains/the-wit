_The Pillowman_

By Martin McDonagh

June 22nd - 30th, 2012

With echoes of Stoppard and Kafka, Martin McDonagh's drama, The Pillowman, is the viciously funny and seriously disturbing tale of a writer in an unnamed totalitarian state who is interrogated about the gruesome content of his short stories and their similarities to a number of child-murders occurring in his town.
