# About The Wit

The Wit strives to be a paradigm for innovative theatre as well as a vital creative resource for the community. It provides a platform upon which artists can collaborate in bringing stories to life that are entertaining, relevant, and provocative.

Our mission is to create immersive moments wherein audiences see and feel themselves reflected onstage.

The Wit is committed to inspiring our audience through inventive captivating productions, and does so by holding to the highest creative standard. 

We utilize the power of theatre to engage discussion and encourage lifelong examination of ourselves, our community, and our world.
